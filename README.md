The project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank using machine learning techniques. It uses a dataset containing customer demographic and account-related features, such as credit score, geography, age, balance, and whether they have exited (churned). Key steps include preprocessing the data, feature scaling, and building classification models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic Regression. The project evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify customers likely to churn, enabling targeted retention strategies.
